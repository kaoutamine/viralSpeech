Going further in our research, we could have done the following:

- Extracted more features from the data avilable to us:
it is reasonable to think that, if we added other features accounting for links with real-world event (for example presidentail elections in the USA, movies release, festivals and events etc.) which have an impact on the media coverage of the people present, we may have been able to justify more of the variability in the data.


- Augmenting features:
exploring the joint contribution of the features we have extracted (such as considering the impact of being an (American, Male, Politician) has on the quotability may also have been insightful.


- Selecting features:
An abundance of some features were extracted by us and used to train our models. This was possible thanks to the large number of training samples available. For the models which worked, L1 regularization could be used and tuned to allow choosing a model using only a subset of these features but achieving very close performance to the un-regularized model
