title: About us and our project
---

We are four EPFL students with an interest in data processing and analysis using advanced data science tools. This project's dataset is called Quotebank and consists of quotes 
that were identified in newspapers articles and when possible assigned possible authors. Combining this with Wikidata to get info on the speakers, we try to explore the data
and compile information and understand interesting things about this dataset using data visualization, Machine learning, NLP processing and other techniques.
